# Changelog

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/dmccaffery/flux-manifests/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0) (2026-08-21)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **aws:** the aws tree now requires the SECRETS_ROLE_PREFIX cluster var -- pair with the terraform-aws-eks-flux release that registers the cluster's IRSA OIDC provider and publishes it.
* the artifact layout contract changes. There is no ./stack entrypoint any more: clusters must sync path "aws" or "google" (terraform-aws-eks-flux / terraform-google-gke-flux >= their matching feat! releases, or a manual kubectl patch fluxinstance flux -n flux-system --type merge -p '{"spec":{"sync":{"path":"aws"}}}'). The CLOUD cluster var is retired, the aws tree requires the aws module's reserved vars (OCI_PROVIDER, ARTIFACT_TAG_PROVIDER, AWS_*, DNS_ZONE_ID, GATEWAY_*) bare, and otel-collector is gone.
* **patchy:** the patchy chart floor moves from 0.5.0 to 0.7.0; a cluster pinning PATCHY_SEMVER below that will fail schema validation on the agent.runners block.
* **rbac:** the devops subject group no longer holds cluster-admin; enrol cluster administrators in the admins group (RBAC_GROUP_ADMINS) instead.
